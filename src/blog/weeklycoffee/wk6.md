**Weekly Coffee #6**
*December 22, 2024*

Unfortunately, I have been slacking, and *Weekly Coffee* has become more like *Monthly Coffee*. I am back in Newport again for Christmas, which has been a nice chance to slow down and relax. Recently, it has felt a bit like I am being pulled in 3 different directions, with close friends and family in San Diego, San Luis Obispo, and Orange County. It is beautiful to have people and places that I love spread out all over California, and it is fun to have a dynamic pattern of visiting everyone and driving up and down the coast a couple of times a month, but it definitely has been an active priority of mine to maintain focus and presence where I am at. Without further ado...

<br>
**Whatâ€™s Been Up:**

   - We had our work Christmas party last week. Overall, it was not too eventful, but it was held at the [Hotel del Coronado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_del_Coronado) in San Diego, which was super cool to see for the first time. The hotel is beautiful and has been in a bunch of movies, including *Some Like It Hot*, which also happens to have the [greatest final scene of all time](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-mHhr-aaLnI)
   - I will be joining the leadership for my young adults group at my church in Carlsbad. I am excited to get more involved and start volunteering more of my time.
   - My friend Max bought a [full set of medieval armor](../../../assets/images/wk6_helmet.jpeg) in an antique shop in Orange.

**What I've Been Reading/Listening To/Watching:**

- I got my [**Spotify Wrapped**](../../../assets/images/wk6_wrapped.jpeg) for 2024 a couple of weeks ago.
    - Here are my [top listened songs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1FoNxXj6qWwRmH?si=h_34JeOGT4OEKVYOxoLNCA&pi=u-IBKUHnJsQRa8&nd=1&dlsi=f39c9102d3774ae8) if anyone is curious.
    - I was pretty shocked to see that I spent 77,265 minutes listening to music in 2024. 3.5 hours a day definitely feels like a lot; it could be good to cultivate more time spent in silence.
- Since my last newsletter, I had a 5-day period of intensely listening to **Joe Rogan's podcast**. Since then, though, I have decided to stop listening, to ground myself a bit more in real life and a bit less in politics. Here were the episodes I listened to and found particularly interesting, though.
    - [Donald Trump](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0e9ynAH6hmZIIeOx0SaGQu?si=815a9c5861254ed2), [JD Vance](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1rdjSPK00vmwl6WBkTYe3l?si=a317b801b2ef4b31), [Elon Musk](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3wUQy68EVwNjTb0yBOhYm9?si=d68a26dd33224727)
        - I thought it was interesting to hear from the incoming administration in a context outside debates or rallies. Although I don't agree with everything they put forward, there was something a lot more humanizing about seeing them on a podcast, discussing the issues that are important to them, and their interests outside politics. The 1:1 podcast format definitely encourages a lot more civility and intelligent discussion than most of the political formats I am used to.
    - [Jonathan Haidt](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1uN7QdwrJuNqESrwYDOfg5?si=1572b0f131bb47a6)
        - He is a social psychologist who spoke a lot about the effects of social media on children. Although I have long been convinced that social media has an *almost entirely negative* effect on society, Haidt finally convinced me that it is a strong enough problem to warrant government intervention, which I am typically fundamentally opposed to.
    - [Peter Thiel](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2DFsA7qIdjZZukcCRbBRhI?si=faf6c88bea6f4a38)

**Song of the Week:**
[Skin - Hans Williams](https://open.spotify.com/track/4uqfL7UKwWPF1bpZok6zGs?si=5fcf2d5c0b4c4a51)
I think 2025 is the year I start listening to more folk music ...

**Picture of the Week:**

I always knew it was ambitious to try and have a new picture each week for *Weekly Coffee*, and I failed again this week. So here's a picture of the Swiss Alps from my trip to Europe last summer.
See you next week!
