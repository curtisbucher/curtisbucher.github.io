    <p><strong>Weekly Coffee #5</strong><br />
<em>November 25, 2024</em></p>
<p>I am up in Newport Beach at my parents' house this week for Thanksgiving. It's been fun being back, it almost feels like I am on a school break. Since last week I finally got all the past weeks of <em>Weekly Coffee</em> up on my website in <a href="https://curtisbucher.com/blog/weekly_coffee_archive/weekly_coffee_archive.html">an archive</a> so now anyone can access them. Without further ado...<br />
<br></p>
<p><strong>Whatâ€™s Been Up:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I went <a href="https://curtisbucher.com/media/wk5_surfing.jpeg">surfing</a> on Saturday for the third time, and this time my brother Jonathan came along! That session had the largest waves I have truly attempted so far, which was spooky. Admittedly though, they were still relatively small.<ul>
<li>When I go surfing, that I am irrationally afraid of cutting a <strong>real</strong> surfer off, which keeps me from trying to catch any <strong>real</strong> waves. I'll probably have to get over that fear eventually...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides that, it was a relatively slow week. Work has picked up a bit as we near a tapeout deadline, so that has been occupying a lot of my bandwidth recently.<br />
<br></p>
<p><strong>What I've Been Reading/Listening To/Watching:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>We Who Wrestle With God</em> - Jordan Peterson</p>
<ul>
<li>Just started the first chapter yesterday, but it has been pretty great so far. In the book, Peterson goes through many of the foundational stories of the Old Testament, examining their psychological and philosophical implications.</li>
<li>Recently, I have been pretty interested in the origins of the West, particularly how many of its fundamental roots are embedded in a Judeo-Christian worldview, and I think that this book will greatly broaden my understanding of this connection. It is becoming dangerously apparent that many of the founding truths of our Liberal Democracies, like equality or individual human rights, are no longer held to be true as the West becomes increasingly "post-Christian" and we lose the religious presuppositions that have led to centuries of freedom and prosperity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Daniel</em> - God</p>
<ul>
<li>We have been going a Daniel series in church, and it has been incredibly fascinating. My pastor is using the story of Daniel to demonstrate what it means to live as a faithful Christian within a pagan culture.<br />
<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Song of the Week:</strong><br />
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4uqfL7UKwWPF1bpZok6zGs?si=-pkemGmhSaeV9-D0SURXgw">Skin - Hans Williams</a><br />
I hadn't heard of this artist prior to this week, but I have been listening to this song about 5 times a day since I found it.<br />
<br></p>
<p><strong>Picture of the Week:</strong><br />
<img alt="A Painting of SLO County By Jenny" src="https://curtisbucher.com/media/wk5_painting.jpeg" /><br />
Jenny painted this for me for our 6th month anniversary, knowing how much I missed San Luis Obispo. See you next week!</p>
