    <p><strong>Weekly Coffee #7</strong><br />
<em>January 11, 2024</em><br />
&emsp;&emsp;Happy (late) New Years everyone! Since it has been difficult to keep up a rhythm of writing <em>Weekly Coffee</em>, I am considering moving to a monthly format of updates, accompanied by longer form writing. It seems like it could be cool to cultivate a habit of some more substantial writing, as suggested by Jonjon.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;It would potentially be a special thing to regularly publish writing to a group of people who I know and respect, and to get feedback from anyone interested enough to read it and connect with the source material. It seems like writing is a necessary practice for fully developing our thoughts on complicated matters, and that by writing down our thoughts we are actually committing to them in an important way.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Part of the inspiration as well comes from my recent reading, the <em>Alexander Hamilton</em> Biography by Ron Chernow. I am only in chapter 3 of 43, so I imagine I will have many more thoughts to share by the time I am finished. However, even in the first 3 chapters it is clear that Hamilton's ability to influence and guide the development of a young United States will stem from his ability to write effectively, and establish his thoughts well.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;While most of us are not in the position to drastically alter the course of history like Hamilton was, it is conceivable that by being intentional in writing and developing our thoughts we can grow to have a positive impact and influence on the people around us.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Particularly, longer form writing seems particularly important in an era where short form communication like texts and tweets seem to be the loudest, most promoted method of communication online. It <em>seems</em> like all the reddit posts and tweets I see online are trying to convince people of something, but I can't imagine that <em>anyone</em> is actually persuaded by something that they read in 280 characters.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;I don't think this issue is necessarily as dire as some may suggest, but I imagine it <strong>must</strong> be a good exercise for me to force myself to write longer, and with more intentionality. Without further ado...<br />

<p><strong>Whats Been Up:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most of my time over Christmas was spent in Newport Beach with my family. It is always incredibly encouraging and refreshing to spend time where I grew up. I really felt back to my roots this time around, surrounded by <a href="../../../assets/images/wk7_cousins.jpeg">extended family</a> and decades long friends. I believe I have mentioned it before, but it can also be a challenge to feel so deeply rooted to my old home. It feels like I am bit stretched thin between everywhere I have lived and built connections.</p>
<ul>
<li>A particularly special moment for me was shared with my Grandma, when she showed me a <a href="../../../assets/images/wk7_grandma.jpeg">book of the 129 people</a> who have come to live with her since 1968, including my Mom before she married my Dad.</li>
<li>My parents also gave me a mysterious letter from a distant relative that was addressed to me shortly after I was born. It referenced a clay figurine man that she wanted me to have, but none of us had any idea exactly what or where it was for the last 20 years...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Christmas, I went up to Sacramento for <a href="../../../assets/images/wk7_jenny.jpeg">New Years with Jenny</a>. On New Years Eve, I got to visit <a href="../../../assets/images/wk7_tahoe2.JPG">Lake Tahoe</a> for the first time, which was beautiful.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What I've Been Reading/Listening To/Watching:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>The Meaning of Marriage</em> - Timothy Keller</p>
<ul>
<li>I have been reading this during my breaks at work and have been incredibly impressed with it so far.<br />
I had been recommended this book by several different people but wanted to wait until I was in serious relationship to start it.</li>
<li>For me, the main value of this book so far has been to develop a scriptural view of what marriage is and means, as well as how to practice marriage the modern day. It has always been clear that society's current view of marriage is <strong>flawed at best</strong>, but even as a Christian, it has been hard for me to understand what that level of commitment truly demands, and how it will change my life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5gXRXgAXqp6iDJT3zilNqf?si=3TZ-mo2rQhWkl4K3FgG47Q"><em>Hebrews</em></a> - Streetlights</p>
<ul>
<li>I was recommended these recordings when I was seeking an alternative to my practice of listening to provocative podcasts on the way to work.</li>
<li>Streetlights records spoken-word chapters from scripture, but they do with an emotionality and musicality that makes it less dry than some other recordings I have tried. It scratches the same itch for me as listening to music.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Mpx8OJbmmblez2Wwpg5ji?si=MNlW8KlGSciD8qTuTNn6AA"><em>Rethinking</em> with guest Sam Altman</a> - Adam Grant</p>
<ul>
<li>A short, somewhat stimulating discussion about the future of AI from Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. The whole time, I was trying to determine if Altman's techno-optimism is genuine, or informed by his (literally) vested interest in OpenAI and the AI revolution. He seemed pretty cavalier about discussing impending AI advancements, seemingly under the impression that society would "figure it all out".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</em> - Taika Waititi</p>
<ul>
<li>An odd, funny movie from New Zealand, about a troubled young boy living for five months in the bush with his foster dad.</li>
<li>I think this movie could be best described as a live action version of Pixar's <em>UP</em>, with funny accents. Stylistically, it seemed to draw inspiration from Wes Anderson.<br />
<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Song of the Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5xRP5iyVdGglqlY4Vcjhkx?si=NxsNWRBlS1i--jKJSEI9eQ">Sinnerman</a> - Nina Simon<ul>
<li>This song legitimately terrified me the first time I heard it. Her evocative depiction of judgement day was haunting coming from an artist that I associate more with Gospel music.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Honorable Mention</em>: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/22wPVzAX55VL0GxTDpwkB4?si=cmNkyVGxQfK7D4eWSoJv9g">Ambien and Fireworks</a> - Ethan Regan<br />
