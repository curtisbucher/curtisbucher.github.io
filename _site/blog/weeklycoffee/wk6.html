    <p><strong>Weekly Coffee #6</strong><br />
<em>December 22, 2024</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have been slacking, and <em>Weekly Coffee</em> has become more like <em>Monthly Coffee</em>. I am back in Newport again for Christmas, which has been a nice chance to slow down and relax. Recently, it has felt a bit like I am being pulled in 3 different directions, with close friends and family in San Diego, San Luis Obispo, and Orange County. It is beautiful to have people and places that I love spread out all over California, and it is fun to have a dynamic pattern of visiting everyone and driving up and down the coast a couple of times a month, but it definitely has been an active priority of mine to maintain focus and presence where I am at. Without further ado...</p>
<p><br><br />
<strong>Whatâ€™s Been Up:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We had our work Christmas party last week. Overall, it was not too eventful, but it was held at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_del_Coronado">Hotel del Coronado</a> in San Diego, which was super cool to see for the first time. The hotel is beautiful and has been in a bunch of movies, including <em>Some Like It Hot</em>, which also happens to have the <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-mHhr-aaLnI">greatest final scene of all time</a></li>
<li>I will be joining the leadership for my young adults group at my church in Carlsbad. I am excited to get more involved and start volunteering more of my time.</li>
<li>My friend Max bought a <a href="../../../assets/images/wk6_helmet.jpeg">full set of medieval armor</a> in an antique shop in Orange.<br />
<br></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I've Been Reading/Listening To/Watching:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I got my <a href="../../../assets/images/wk6_wrapped.jpeg"><strong>Spotify Wrapped</strong></a> for 2024 a couple of weeks ago.<ul>
<li>Here are my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1FoNxXj6qWwRmH?si=h_34JeOGT4OEKVYOxoLNCA&amp;pi=u-IBKUHnJsQRa8&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=f39c9102d3774ae8">top listened songs</a> if anyone is curious.</li>
<li>I was pretty shocked to see that I spent 77,265 minutes listening to music in 2024. 3.5 hours a day definitely feels like a lot; it could be good to cultivate more time spent in silence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since my last newsletter, I had a 5-day period of intensely listening to <strong>Joe Rogan's podcast</strong>. Since then, though, I have decided to stop listening, to ground myself a bit more in real life and a bit less in politics. Here were the episodes I listened to and found particularly interesting, though.<ul>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0e9ynAH6hmZIIeOx0SaGQu?si=815a9c5861254ed2">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1rdjSPK00vmwl6WBkTYe3l?si=a317b801b2ef4b31">JD Vance</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3wUQy68EVwNjTb0yBOhYm9?si=d68a26dd33224727">Elon Musk</a><ul>
<li>I thought it was interesting to hear from the incoming administration in a context outside debates or rallies. Although I don't agree with everything they put forward, there was something a lot more humanizing about seeing them on a podcast, discussing the issues that are important to them, and their interests outside politics. The 1:1 podcast format definitely encourages a lot more civility and intelligent discussion than most of the political formats I am used to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1uN7QdwrJuNqESrwYDOfg5?si=1572b0f131bb47a6">Jonathan Haidt</a><ul>
<li>He is a social psychologist who spoke a lot about the effects of social media on children. Although I have long been convinced that social media has an <em>almost entirely negative</em> effect on society, Haidt finally convinced me that it is a strong enough problem to warrant government intervention, which I am typically fundamentally opposed to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2DFsA7qIdjZZukcCRbBRhI?si=faf6c88bea6f4a38">Peter Thiel</a><br />
<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Song of the Week:</strong><br />
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4uqfL7UKwWPF1bpZok6zGs?si=5fcf2d5c0b4c4a51">Skin - Hans Williams</a><br />
I think 2025 is the year I start listening to more folk music ...<br />
<br></p>
<p><strong>Picture of the Week:</strong><br />
<img alt="The Swiss Alps, from Jonjon and I's Europe Trip This Summer" src="../../../assets/images/wk6_alps.jpeg" /><br />
I always knew it was ambitious to try and have a new picture each week for <em>Weekly Coffee</em>, and I failed again this week. So here's a picture of the Swiss Alps from my trip to Europe last summer.<br />
See you next week!</p>
